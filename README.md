#### Overview
Our system will have a webcam to stream video and a microphone to stream audio. In addition, our system will notify users based on certain events (i.e. spike in audio) and have a speaker to playback saved audio (i.e. for parents to comfort their baby). Some additional features are remote control of the system, including turning the system on/off, moving the camera (could be automatic based on motion sensor), controlling audio volume, zooming in/out of video, etc.
